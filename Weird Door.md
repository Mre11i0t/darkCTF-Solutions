I found this new type of steganography technique which hides stuff very effieciently 
utilizing Invisible charecters in unicode and its not complete yet It uses encryption so 
that even if you found the tool which I used you cant break in easily
`NOTE:Dont cat the file in terminal and copy the text some text editor`

### Hint 1
Mind reading the challenge text too it may help you get the flag and the password is Case Sensitive

# Solution
This chall was pretty simple if you did see every part of the chall and have some knowledge of Harry Potter (Not mandatory though) 
the description mentioned about a steganography technique which utilizes inivisible unicode charecters and uses encryption on it again.
So the flow of solving the chall is you need to sum up the information and do a google search you will find about stegcloak which leads you to https://stegcloak.surge.sh/

Then if you see the chall text its pretty intresting and says about Death (Fictional charecter in Harrypotter who gave invisiblity cloak to Dumbledore and later given to HarryPotter)
and also said about the door and a spell which breaks it as this is the password and its a spell
