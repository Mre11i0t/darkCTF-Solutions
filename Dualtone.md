## Solution

The description says two tones so obviously its DTMF Ive used this to decode in every chall I participated so it may help you too http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/
using this tool you only get 30secs of DTMF so basically you can break the wav and stich the decoded strings all together to get binary.If youve seen the description it says something about blind
which is Brailee https://www.dcode.fr/braille-alphabet use this and decode and get your flag xD
